        3. Gathering, Use and Disclosure of Non-personally-identifying
        Information.
      </h5>
      <p>
        Users of the Website Generally: “Non-Personally-Identifying Information”
        is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot
        be directly associated with a specific person. “Personally-Identifying
        Information,” by contrast, is information such as a name or email
        address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific
        person. Like most website operators, Company gathers from users of the
        Website Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that Web
        browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That
        information includes the user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address,
        operating system and browser type, and the locations of the Web pages
        the user views right before arriving at, while navigating and
        immediately after leaving the Website. Although such information is not
        personally identifiable, it may be possible for Company to determine
        from an IP address a user’s Internet service provider and the geographic
        location of the visitor’s point of connectivity as well as other
        statistical usage data. Company analyzes Non-Personally-Identifying
        Information gathered from users of the Website to help Company better
        understand how the Website is being used. By identifying patterns and
        trends in usage, Company is able to better design the Website to improve
        users’ experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. From time
        to time, Company may also release the Non-Personally-Identifying
        Information gathered from Website users in the aggregate, such as by
        publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.
      </p>

      <p>
        Web Cookies: A “Web Cookie” is a string of information which assigns you
        a unique identification that a website stores on a user’s computer, and
        that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user
        submits a query to the site. Company uses Web Cookies to track the pages
        that users visit during each Website session, both to help Company
        improve users’ experiences and to help Company understand how the
        Website is being used. As with other Non-Personally-Identifying
        Information gathered from users of the Website, Company analyzes and
        discloses in aggregated form information gathered using Web Cookies, so
        as to help Company, its partners and others better understand how the
        Website is being used. The Web Cookies may also be recognized when you
        visit other websites in order to present ads to you about Company’s
        services or our affiliates’ services. WEBSITE USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO
        HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO
        REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING
        THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT
        THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. WEBSITE USERS WHO REFUSE WEB COOKIES ASSUME ALL
        RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.

        Third Party Advertisers: We may use third-party advertising companies to
        serve ads when you visit the Website. These companies may use
        information about your visits to this and other websites that are
        contained in Web Cookies in order to provide advertisements about goods
        and services of interest to you. Using a tool created by the Network
        Advertising Initiative, you can opt out of several third party ad
        servers’ and networks’ Web Cookies simultaneously. If you would like

        Web Beacons: A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page
        or email that is usually invisible to the user and allows website
        operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page or an
        email. Company may use Web Beacons on the Website and in emails to count
        users who have visited particular pages, viewed emails, and to deliver
        co-branded services. Web Beacons are not used to access users’
        Personally-Identifying Information; they are a technique Company may use
        to compile aggregated statistics about Website usage. Web Beacons
        collect only a limited set of information including a Web Cookie number,
        time and date of a page or email view, and a description of the page or
        email on which the Web Beacon resides. You may not decline Web Beacons,
        however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all Web Cookies
        or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a Web Cookie
        is tendered and permit you to accept or decline Web Cookies on an
        individual basis.

        Analytics: We may use third-party vendors, including Google, who use
        first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and
        third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to provide
        analytics services, inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past
        activity on our websites and applications, including Google Analytics
        for Display Advertising. These vendors may use Web Cookies, Web Beacons
        and other technologies to collect information about your use of the
        Website, our service and other websites, including your IP address, web
        browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion
        information. This information may be used by us and others to, among

        certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your
        interests on our service and other websites and better understand your
        online activity. If you do not want any information to be collected and
        used by Google Analytics, you can install an opt-out in your web browser
        (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) and/or opt out from Google
        Analytics for Display Advertising or the Google Display Network. You can
        do so by using Google’s Ads Settings (www.google.com/settings/ads). For
