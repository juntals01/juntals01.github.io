      <h3>Before you start, read this</h3>
      <p>
        This tutorial is about how to create a free website. This is not the
        same with other websites that offer free builders with a slow response
        time. This method will give your website a fast enough response time for
        decent to fairly huge web users. You will have your own VPS or Virtual
        Private Server. You will have full access to your server and files. You
        can fully customize your website or hire a web developer.
      </p>
      <p className="px-6 py-4 mt-10 bg-[#ebebeb]">
        This step-by-step process involves technicality. Your main goal is to
        build a website for free without monthly payment. This is the trade-off
        instead of a ready-made website. You either do this for your business or
        just to test it out but I assure you that at the end of this tutorial,
        you will be able to create a website that will be able to handle up to
        1, 000 concurrent visitors.
      </p>
      <p className="bg-primary text-white font-extrabold inline-block px-6 py-4 mt-8 rounded-lg">
        Expect that you will spend 1 to 3 hours building your website.
      </p>
      <h3>Don&apos;t know any code?</h3>
      <p>No problem — you don&apos;t need to.</p>
      <p>
        I wrote this guide specifically for beginners. You can just copy and
        paste all the code provided. Just follow the instructions. There will be
        pictures on each step that will help you check if you are on the right
        track.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of this process, you will be able to create a mid-level
        website that is perfect for an average business website.
      </p>
      <h3>What a website needs</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>A domain name. (ex. www.facebook.com, google.com)</li>
        <li>
          Hosting server &#45; This is where your code is compiled. (ex. Oracle,
          Godaddy, Hostinger)
        </li>
        <li>
          Your website&apos;s code &#45; In this tutorial, we will use
          WordPress.
        </li>
      </ol>

      >
        Step 1. Choose a domain name (www.your-website-name.com)
      </h3>
      <p className="mt-10">
        <strong>First things first: What is a Domain Name?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Domain name is the web address of your site. Without a domain name, you
        will be able to access your website via a public IP address (ex.
        101.xx.xx.123). A website can function without a domain name, but your
        users will not be able to remember your website. Numbers are harder to
        remember than words. Many website owners prefer to have a domain name
        using their company name.
      </p>
      <p>In choosing a domain name, What I recommend are the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your domain name should be the same as your company name.</li>
        <li>You omit the www. Just use your-company.com</li>
        <li>Try to get .com extension of a domain name.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="px-6 py-4 mt-10 bg-[#ebebeb]">
        Be aware that domain names are being targeted for business gain. Many
        businesses are hoarding domain names. They buy domain names early on and
        resell them at a higher price. Reserve your domain name now by buying
        them early.
      </p>
      <p>
        Free domain names usually end with .net, .org, .co.uk, .ca, .de, or
        other free extensions. Google SEO prefers .com, .org, and .io website
        extensions. I will talk about SEO in another tutorial. We will focus on
        getting a domain name first.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have already decided what domain name you are going to use for
        your website, choose either register to a free domain or reserve one
        now. Click one of the choices below and a new tab will open a
        step-by-step process of registering your domain name.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          (Free) Register a free domain name using Freenom
          (https://www.freenom.com/)
        </li>
        <li>
          (Paid) (min 8.00 USD/yr.) Buy your domain name using NameCheap
          (https://www.namecheap.com/)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>
          <b>Note:</b> There are many paid domain name server websites. However,
          for now, we choose NameCheap.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>After registering your domain name, you can now close that tab.</p>
      <p>We will now proceed to step 2 and set up you&apos;re hosting. </p>
      <h4

        className="bg-secondary px-4 py-6 text-white"
      >
        Step 2. Register for a free web hosting plan
      </h4>
      <p>
        In this tutorial, we will use the Oracle Always-Free web hosting plan.
        This is the only web hosting plan that offers always-free Virtual
        Private Server. The only catch is that you need to stick with the free
        tier limit. This part is a technical one. Don&apos;t worry, I will guide
        you every step of the way.
      </p>
      <h3>Free and reliable Virtual Private Server</h3>
      <p className="px-6 py-4 mt-10 bg-[#ebebeb]">
        I&apos;ve been developing websites for years now. In my experience, only
        Oracle gives free web hosting which did not incur a single cent on my
        credit card. My website has been running for almost two years now and
        currently serves almost 5, 000 users per day.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3>From my experience…</h3>
      <p>
        If you have a café business and you want your customers to visit your
        website, this free web hosting server is more than enough to serve your
        customers.
      </p>
      <p className="px-6 py-4 mt-10 bg-[#ebebeb]">
        I wrote this blog mainly to help small to medium businesses set up their
        reliable website. I have tested this with businesses like roofing,
        restaurants, weddings, and small e-commerce websites.
      </p>
      <p>Enough of this, I will now guide you to setting up your server.</p>
      <h3>Setting up your own Oracle Always-Free web hosting server</h3>
      <p>
        Setting up your account is a bit tedious and needs to have a valid
        input. Oracle verifies users using a credit card. Your account
        information needs to be exactly the same as your credit card
        information. I have provided a note and a video link on where many
        people failed to register and the solution to it.
      </p>
      <p>Please be patient and follow every step of the way.</p>
      <h3 className="bg-primary text-white font-extrabold inline-block px-6 py-4 mt-8 rounded-lg">
        Register an Oracle account.
      </h3>
      <p>
        There are 12 steps involved in registering an account up to signing in.
        In each step, I will provide a screenshot to guide you throughout the
        process.

          Step 3. Create a Web Server
        </h3>
        <p>
          In this process, you will provision an instance to create a web
          server. Basically, you need to install a machine. It&apos;s like
          installing an operating system like Windows and installing the
          programs.
        </p>
        <h5>Before we proceed</h5>
        <p>
          To create your website, you will be using WordPress. In creating a web
          server, we need to install the software that is needed to run
          WordPress.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of writing, the WordPress version is 6.4.3. The requirements to run
          this specific version are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>PHP version 7.4 or greater.</li>
          <li>
            MySQL version 8.0 or greater OR MariaDB version 10.4 or greater.
          </li>
          <li>Apache or Nginx &#45; We will use Nginx</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>What you need</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Operating System - We will use the Ubuntu Server operating system.
          </li>
          <li>Web Server - We will use Nginx</li>
          <li>
